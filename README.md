# Bankist-App
Fiction Banking app 

In order to login the data for testing is:

USER: ab
PINN: 1111


USER: jw
PINN: 2222

To transfer money you need to specify the account.
Ex: if you log in with user (ab) and you want to transfer money you need to enter the name of the second accound and that is (jw).
In this way you will see the money transfered from your account to the other account.

Thank you for testing my app.
See you!
